## Allhomes Property Database

This is a learning project to extract property data from Allhomes listing pages based on a pre-defined query and then save it to an SQL Server database.

The code tracks changes so that every time the script is run old rows are expired and new details added.

Future work:
* adding average transit times from Canberra Civic to the property by public transport and car
* improve formatting of email
* include database DDL to re-create
* add modules to check other property sites and save to database
